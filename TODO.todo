Azalea
------

Features:
    - Add `azalea upgrade`

Bugs:
    - Fix exporting to .mrpack (mc and fabric versions missing in header)
    - Fix server/client/both side (currently all `null` in the `json`)

Long-term goals:
    - Support other modloaders than fabric
    - Fix shader loaders when downloading shaders (currently hardcoded options that don't check if required mod is installed, ex. iris)
    - Add server-ready export (server export)
